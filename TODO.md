# ToDo
    * Carnivores should split up above a certain population
    * Herbivores should gravitate towards more vegetated zones
# Ideas
    * Carnivores should not be able to go into zones with a certain herbivore population (maybe in relation to the carnivore population that is moving into the zone)
    * Game idea: you control the different rates and either: 1.  try to balance it out, maybe with a focus on more points for example carnivores, which should be the hardest to control (could be fun if you know the time left and start to spread more carnivores in the end, with the risk of them depleting the herbivores) 2. reach a certain mix of the populations
    * Game idea: you are the seed master, and you control where the different species start out and then you need to get as much points as possible after a certain time (or until some species take over)
    * Idea: something like, carnivores are greedy, but if they go into a zone with too much herbivore they will be killed
# Bugs

    * The zones turn white in the beginning for some reason
